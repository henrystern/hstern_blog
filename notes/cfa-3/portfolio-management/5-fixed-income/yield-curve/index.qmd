# Key Concepts

The primary yield curve risk factors are level, slope, and shape. Yield curve changes can be decomposed into these factors by principal components analysis.

$$
\begin{split}
    \text{butterfly spread} = &\ 2\cdot \text{medium-term yield} \\ &-\text{short term yield} \\ &- \text{long term yield}
\end{split}
$$

Taylor approximation of present value for change in yield:
$$
  \%\Delta PV ^{\text{Full}} \approx -(\text{ModDur}\cdot \Delta \text{Yield})+(\frac{1}{2} \cdot \text{Convexity} \cdot \left(\Delta \text{yield})^2 \right)
$$

A bond with higher convexity will gain more from a rate decrease and lose less from a rate increase.

# Yield Curve Strategies

An investor who believes the yield curve is static can increase returns by increasing duration or leverage of the portfolio.

Buying a bond with a maturity longer than the investment horizon will yield more than one that matches the investment horizon by rolling down the yield curve. 

Financing a long term purchase at repo rates generates a repo carry return if the rolldown yield exceeds the financing cost.

A receive-fixed swap is like a repo carry but pays a market reference rate instead of the repo rate.

Bull Steepening
: Short term rates fall more than long term rates

Bear Steepening
: Long term rates rise more than short term rates

Bear steepening scenario should short duration, bull should long duration.

A butterfly position combines an intermediate bullet position with a long and short term barbell position.

# Active Fixed-Income Management Across Currencies

Covered interest rate parity
: $$
  F(\frac{DC}{FC}, \ T) = S_0(\frac{DC}{FC})\frac{(1+r_{DC})^{T}}{(1+r_{FC})^{T}}
$$

Butterfly spread
: Twice the intermediate term rate minus the short term and long term rates
