# Introduction

Macro attribution measures the effects of the fund sponsor's decisions on returns.

Micro attribution measures the impact of the individual portfolio manager's decisions.

# Equity Attribution

## BHB Model

The allocation effect = $\sum_{i}^{K}(w_i - W_i) \cdot B_i$ or the difference between portfolio and benchmark weights multiplied by the benchmark return summed over each asset class. 

The selection effect is $\sum_{i}^{K} W_i (R_i - B_i)$.

The two effects may not explain the entire excess return. 

The interaction effect explains the remaining difference. It is $\sum_{i}^{K} (w_i - W_i)(R_i - B_i)$.

# Brinson-Fachler Model

: $$
  A_i = (w_i - W_i) (B_i - B)
