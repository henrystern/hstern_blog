This is problem 12.5 from @nicholson2017-MicroeconomicTheoryBasic. The textbook solution used a linear approximation but it is actually a good example of a parametric integral. Since calculus textbooks almost exclusively use physics to demonstrate applications of integration, I thought I'd work through an econ example.

## Problem 12.5

Suppose that demand, the supply of entrepreneurial talent, and long-run cost for a competitive industry are given by
$$\begin{gather}
  D(P) = 1500 - 50P \\
  Q_s = .25w \\
  C(q) = 0.5q^2 - 10q + w,
\end{gather}$$
where $P$ is output price, $w$ is the entrepreneur's wage, and $q$ is firm output.

Assume that each firm requires exactly one entrepreneur (so $n = .25w$).

### Part a)
Find the long-run equilibrium --- setting $P = MC = AC$, $Q = n \cdot q$, and substituting $w = 4n$, we find
$$\begin{align*}
  S = \sqrt{8}n^{3 / 2} = n(P + 10)
\end{align*}$$

Then letting $D = S$, we find $n^* = 50$.

### Part b)
Find the new equilibrium if demand shifts to $D(P) = 2428 - 50P$. Setting $D = S$ again we find $n^* = 72$.

### Part c)
The interesting one. Show that the increase in rents accruing to the entrepreneurs is identical to the change in long-run producer surplus along the market supply curve.

The change in rents is easy. We know that,
$$\begin{align*}
  Q_s = .25w &= n \\
  \implies w &= 4n
\end{align*}$$

So the increase in rents is the integral,
$$\begin{align*}
  \int_{50}^{72} 4n\ dn.
\end{align*}$$

To find the producer surplus along the market supply curve treat $S = \sqrt{8}n^{3/ 2}$ as a parametric equation for the $x$ coordinate of the supply curve as $n$ changes. We know that $S = \sqrt{8}n^{3/2} = n(P + 10)$ so $P = \sqrt{8n} - 10$: a parametric equation for the $y$ coordinate of the supply curve in terms of $n$.

We want to find the area to the left of the supply curve, so reversing the order of the formula for the area under a parametric curve,^[If you're not familiar with this technique you can read the derivation in @site-2018-10CalculusParametric]
$$\begin{align}
  \Delta PS &= \int_{50}^{72} S \cdot P'\ dn \\
     &= \int_{50}^{72} \sqrt{8}n^{3 / 2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{2}{n}}\ dn \\
     &= \int_{50}^{72} 4n\ dn.
\end{align}$$

Which shows the change in rents is identical to the change in producer surplus.
