Only half of scores are in the 6 to 44 range with the other half being described by just 7 points from 45 to 51. There appears to be substantial risk of being rounded away from true performance. An 80th percentile test-taker would either be rounded down to a 73rd percentile score or up to an 87th percentile score, with neither score accurately representing their ability. \n\nOn a Z-Score basis the top three GMAT scores are very close together and yet they contain fully 25 percent of test-takers. It is unlikely that the true distribution of quantitative ability would be so concentrated between $.75\\sigma$ and $1\\sigma$. The test may be struggling to reliably differentiate test-takers at the top end introducing greater variation in scores for test takers of the same ability.\n\nAt the low end there is the opposite problem of high definition. The test extends past $-3\\sigma$ while the GRE only extends to $-2.25\\sigma$. For low performing test takers the GMAT will provide far more detail as to the lack of quantitative ability and extreme outcomes are more likely.\n\nThe GRE scores are much more evenly distributed across the curve and are far more similar to a normal distribution particularly at the low end. The curve exhibits some negative skew with moderately good scores appearing more often than they would under the normal distribution.\n\nPerfect GRE quantitative scores are slightly rarer than they would be under a normal distribution.\n\nOverall the GRE appears more likely to report a score that is close to the test-taker's true ability. The greater definition makes GRE scores more informative than GMAT scores at the top end.\n\n# Total\n\nThe GMAT reports a total score percentile alongside section scores, but the GRE does not.\n\nThe GRE has released some quartile data that could give us some indication of the distribution; but I'm not convinced it is reliable. It presents a score of 300 as both 50th percentile and 42nd percentile which calls into doubt the entire report. The data is also from 2011-2012, a different period to the section score data used above. Accordingly, I'm not going to bother plotting it.

GRE quantitative scores appear far more informative and consistent than the GMAT. The GMAT quantitative distribution is highly abnormal and only extends to $1\\sigma$ above the mean.\n\nFor total scores we can see that GMAT scores are not normally distributed. Low scores are more likely and high scores are less likely than they would be under a normal distribution.\n\nUltimately the GRE appears to give more consistent and informative results. Very good scores are more common on the GRE and I expect results would be more consistent for GRE test-takers of equal ability.\n",
