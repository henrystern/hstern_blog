In what should have been an easy contest, Barbara managed to fault twice. First failing to load her typewriter with paper and then, in the redo, typing only gibberish.\n\nThe next week Letterman revisited the segment with three experts and determined that Barbara had positioned her right hand incorrectly resulting in the mixed up letters.\n\nThat was the end of Barbara's odyssey on late night, and largely the end of her recognition as the world's fastest typist. But one thing that was never answered was how fast she actually typed on the show.\n\nLuckily, Letterman showed what Barbara typed to the camera. It looked like this:\n\n::: {#e43446fc .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code code-fold=\"true\"}\nfrom collections import Counter\nfrom IPython.display import display, Markdown\nbarb = (\n    \"i \"\n    \"g ntele i- a lussel, ol lussel-, in i- a ma/k vtes \"\n    \"nte pinrtel vti/e nourtisc ti- p/ane, wake- asy wonios sanula//y \"\n    \"a--orianeh vint ti- pinrt ol lictnatseh .inrtel -visc- ti- glee gon pa-n nte \"\n    \"mark ehce og nte pinrtel;- a- lunmel te i- lequileh no pinrt no nte mannel exrepn \"\n    \"no -erosh ma-e os a pirk \"\n    \"op/ay. nte pinrtel, vti/e nourtisc tp- p/ane geisn- a ntlov ne \"\n)\nchars = Counter(barb)\ndisplay(Markdown(f\"\"\"\n> {barb}\n\nThis immediately gives an upper-bound to her performance of just {chars.total() / 5} words per minute.^[Using the conventional 5 characters per word] This makes it clear that her performance was a long way from her claim of 170 WPM, but this upper-bound does not account for errors.

To determine her actual WPM we have to decipher what she typed and compare it the 1984 Official Baseball Rules Section 8.05 \"The Balk Rule\".\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nI started by defining some keyboard layouts as lists of lists.\n\n::: {#b00e8030 .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nqwerty = [\n    [\"q\", \"w\", \"e\", \"r\", \"t\", \"y\", \"u\", \"i\", \"o\", \"p\", \"[\", \"]\", \"\\\\\"],\n    [\"a\", \"s\", \"d\", \"f\", \"g\", \"h\", \"j\", \"k\", \"l\", \";\", \"'\", \"\\n\"],\n    [\"z\", \"x\", \"c\", \"v\", \"b\", \"n\", \"m\", \",\", \".\", \"/\"],\n    [\" \"],\n]\n\ndvorak = [\n    [\"'\", \",\", \".\", \"p\", \"y\", \"f\", \"g\", \"c\", \"r\", \"l\", \"/\", \"=\", \"\\\\\"],\n    [\"a\", \"o\", \"e\", \"u\", \"i\", \"d\", \"h\", \"t\", \"n\", \"s\", \"-\", \"\\n\"],\n    [\";\", \"q\", \"j\", \"k\", \"x\", \"b\", \"m\", \"w\", \"v\", \"z\"],\n    [\" \"],\n]\n\n# Dvorak with right hand shifted one space. <CR> is a double width key.\ndvorak_p1 = [\n    [\"'\", \",\", \".\", \"p\", \"y\", \"g\", \"c\", \"r\", \"l\", \"/\", \"=\", \"\\\\\", \"#\"],\n    [\"a\", \"o\", \"e\", \"u\", \"i\", \"h\", \"t\", \"n\", \"s\", \"-\", \"\\n\", \"\\n\"],\n    [\";\", \"q\", \"j\", \"k\", \"x\", \"m\", \"w\", \"v\", \"z\", \"#\"],\n    [\" \"],\n]\n```\n:::\n\n\nThen I defined some functions for mapping input in one layout to output in another layout.\n\n::: {#46f6ec49 .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef map_keys(keys):\n    map = {}\n    for i, row in enumerate(keys):\n        for j, key in enumerate(row):\n            map[key] = [i, j]\n    return map\n\n\ndef decipher(s, input_key, output_key):\n    input_map = map_keys(input_key)\n    out = []\n    for char in s:\n        i, j = input_map[char]\n        out.append(output_key[i][j])\n    return ''.join(out).upper()\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {#6ee5f9c7 .cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code code-fold=\"true\"}\nbarb_fixed = decipher(barb, dvorak_p1, dvorak)\ndisplay(Markdown(f\"\"\"\nDeciphering Barbara's typing from dvorak_p1 to dvorak gives:\n\n> {barb_fixed}\n\"\"\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n\nDeciphering Barbara's typing from dvorak_p1 to dvorak gives:\n\n> I F THERE IS A RUNNER, OR RUNNERS, IT IS A BALK WHEN THE PITCHER WHILE TOUCHING HIS PLATE, MAKES ANY MOTION NATURALLY ASSOCIATED WITH HIS PITCH OR RIGHTAHNED .ITCHER SWINGS HIS FREE FOT PAST THE BACK EDGE OF THE PITCHER;S AS RUTBER HE IS REQUIRED TO PITCH TO THE BATTER EXCEPT TO SECOND BASE ON A PICK OPLAY.

It is understandable that she was nervous and positioned her hands incorrectly but even correcting for that error her performance was deeply unimpressive --- amounting to less than half of her claimed speed. \n\nShe does not appear to have thrown the competition, correcting for her hand position the text was fairly legible but she still made several typos and copied the text incorrectly. This would not be the performance expected of the world's fastest typist. \n\nRegardless, Letterman said that Barbara's opponent wrote just 50 words so we can conclude that Barbara won the competition with a speed of 73 WPM. In all likelihood this makes her undefeated in her competitive typing career.\n\n",
